    "# 3. Working With Pinecone Vector Database\n",
    "Although Vector Databases have existed long before Large Language Models, vector DBs have become an important part of many LLM solutions. In particular, Retreival Augmented Generation (or RAG) architecture addresses LLM's halucinations and issues with longer-term memory by augmenting the user's prompt with the results of a search accross a vector DB. [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) is a cloud-based vector database that is easy to integrate with your CML workflow, as this notebook shows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the previous exervice you created CML jobs to scrape a site and load each page into Pinecone vector DB. This notebook will focus on interacting with Pinecone from a Jupyter notebook.\n",

      "ML RuntimesCloudera Docs ML Runtimes ML Runtimes are responsible for running data science workloads and intermediating       access to the underlying cluster.  CML allows you to run any code via an interactive session, scheduled job, or deployed model          or application. Data Scientists can use interactive sessions to explore data, or develop a          model. They can create jobs and schedule them to run at specified times or productionize          their work as a model to provide a REST endpoint or as an application that offers an          interactive data dashboard for business users. All of these workloads run inside an ML          Runtime container on top of Kubernetes.  Cloudera ML Runtimes are purpose built to serve a specific use-case. They are available          with a single editor (for example, Workbench, Jupyterlab), ship a single language Kernel          (for example, Python 3.8 or R 4.0), and have a set of UNIX tools and utilities or language          libraries and packages.  ML Runtimes have been open sourced and are available in the cloudera/ml-runtimes GitHub repository. If you need to understand your Runtime          environments fully or want to build a new Runtime from scratch,  you can access the          Dockerfiles that were used to build the ML Runtime container images in this repository. There is a wide range of supported Runtimes out-of-the-box that cover the large majority of          Data Science use-cases, but any special requirements can be satisfied by building a custom          ML Runtime container image. CML also supports quota management for CPU, GPU, and memory to limit the amount of          resources users have access to within the CML workspace.  Before ML Runtimes, CML offered similar functionalities via Legacy Engines. These          deprecated container images followed a monolithic architecture, all kernels (Python, R,          Scala), and all seemingly useful packages and libraries were included in the image.
